                    <h1>Hey, thanks for visiting my site!</h1>
                    <p>My name is Daniel and I wanna to tell you a little about myself.
                        I'm 25 years old, a former officer and currently student at the Richeman
                        University also known as the "IDC-Center". My hobbies are running and drawing.
                        I've always been liked computers and programming and that's what lead me to sign for the Bsc in
                        computer science.
                        In my years as programmer I've been learning a lot of languages such as:
                        Java,Python,C,Sql,Javascript and more, but my special skills
                        are in Python and Java.
                        I'm highly motivated student, have management experience, creativity and fast learning skills.
